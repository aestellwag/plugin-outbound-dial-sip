# Twilio Flex Plugin - Outbound Dialing with SIP

Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

This plugin provides a straight forward way to change the default outbound dialing behavior in Flex to target SIP Endpoint(s).  Without this plugin all calls will traverse the Twilio Super Network.  There are times where you may want to direct outbound calls to a SIP endpoint (you can find more information on how these works in Twilio here: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/sip-interface).  The plugin in it's current state only changes the behavior for defined list of numbers.  If you wish to have all calls leverage SIP endpoints, I will describe that within this README below.

## Pre-req

To deploy this plugin, you will need:

- An active Twilio account with Flex provisioned. Refer to the [Flex Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/quickstart/flex-basics#sign-up-for-or-sign-in-to-twilio-and-create-a-new-flex-project") to create one.
- npm version 5.0.0 or later installed (type `npm -v` in your terminal to check)
- Node.js version 10.12.0 or later installed (type `node -v` in your terminal to check)
- [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart#install-twilio-cli) along with the [Flex CLI Plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/plugins#available-plugins) and the [Serverless Plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/plugins#available-plugins). Run the following commands to install them:
  ```
  # Install the Twilio CLI
  npm install twilio-cli -g
  ```
- A GitHub account

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Navigate to the primary plugin folder and run NPM install for the plugin
```bash
cd plugin-outbound-dialing-sip
npm install
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running (from the root plugin directory):

```bash
Twilio flex:plugins:start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

## Updating Dialing Permission

To make changes to the numbers that are allowed/restricted:

```bash
Navigate to ./src/listeners/CustomListeners.js
Modify the emergencyNumbers and numbers to reflect your business needs
**If you wish to have all calls leverage your SIP endpoint(s), you can simply remove the number check and have it overwrite for all calls!
```

## Deploy

When you are ready to deploy your plugin, in your terminal run:
```
Run: 
twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Notes for this version" --description "Functionality of the plugin"
```
For more details on deploying your plugin, refer to the [deploying your plugin guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/plugins#deploying-your-plugin).

## View your plugin in the Plugins Dashboard

After running the suggested next step with a meaningful name and description, navigate to the [Plugins Dashboard](https://flex.twilio.com/admin/) to review your recently deployed and released plugin. Confirm that the latest version is enabled for your contact center.

You are all set to test the Dialing Restrictions within your Flex instance.  Simply login to Flex as a user and attempt to dial outbound to a number you restricted.  You should see a notification indicating that the number has been restricted and "abort" the outbound dialing action from happening!
